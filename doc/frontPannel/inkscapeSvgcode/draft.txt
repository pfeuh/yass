Hello,

I have done some jobs with svgwrite to create files for laser cut and engraving. I have encoutered somme probems, I would like to discuss about them with you. Perhaps it's only a misunderstanding of mine as there is not so much information about svgwrite.

Objects-Paths problem

I've generated some code in a brand new svg file, but I have to load it in inkscape, select all and use the menu item change object(s) to path(s). Is there a way to do it directly with svgwrite?

Scale problem

When I open a generated file file in inkscape, I have to scale them with a 3.77 ratio. Is there a way to do it with svgwrite?

I think you are at 99% of a really useful program. I've noticed that only a really few people use it, it's a shame. Perhaps just some modifications and documentation can fix this?

Best regards,
